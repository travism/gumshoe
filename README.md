# What is Gumshoe?

Gumshoe is an easy way to look at log files in real time using a web based interface. It uses [Twitter's bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/),
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [socket.io](http://socket.io) to provide powerful debugging tools for your applications. A common usage for this tool is to
evaluate multiple log files simultaneously and remotely. Perfect for a development environment or protected portion of
your server. We most commonly use the tool to test API's and server code as devices access our resources, exosing this data easily increases the efficiency of your QA process.
